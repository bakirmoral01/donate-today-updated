            <p>Last month, a devastating flash flood struck the northeastern districts of Sylhet and Sunamganj in
                Bangladesh. The continuous heavy rainfall in the north-eastern Indian region terribly affected more than
                2 million people who live on the Surma-Kushiyara riverâ€™s bank of Bangladesh.</p>
